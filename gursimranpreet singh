    <p class="Para1"Camping is a type of outdoor learning and recreation that involves spending the night in a simple, makeshift shelter, like a tent. A recreational vehicle, covered cabins, a permanent tent, a tarp or bivy, or no shelter at all can also be used for camping.<q> The majority of participants depart from developed areas to spend time outside engaging in enjoyable or educational activities. What sets camping apart from other outdoor activities like day trips and picnics is spending the night away from home.</p>
    <p class="Para2">In the early 20th century, camping gained popularity among elites as a leisure activity. It became more and more well-liked over time among other socioeconomic groups. Contemporary campers often visit state and national parks, wilderness areas, and commercial campgrounds that are owned by the government. Some nations, like Sweden and Scotland, permit public camping on privately owned territory. Many youth organizations, including Scouting, use camping as a key component to teach both self-reliance and teamwork. In addition to their many advantages, school camping trips can be very important for students' personal development.</p>
